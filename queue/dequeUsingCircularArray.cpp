/*
Problem:
Implementation of Deque using circular array
Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends.In previous post we had discussed introduction of deque. Now in this post we see how we implement deque Using circular array.
Operations on Deque:
Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:
insetFront(): Adds an item at the front of Deque.
insertRear(): Adds an item at the rear of Deque.
deleteFront(): Deletes an item from front of Deque.
deleteRear(): Deletes an item from rear of Deque.

In addition to above operations, following operations are also supported
getFront(): Gets the front item from queue.
getRear(): Gets the last item from queue.
isEmpty(): Checks whether Deque is empty or not.
isFull(): Checks whether Deque is full or not.

Algorithms:
 In the function

Time Complexity: 
All operations like insertfront(), insertlast(), deletefront(), deletelast()is O(1).

Output:
get rear element 10
after delete rear element new rear 5
get front element  15
after delete front element new front 5
